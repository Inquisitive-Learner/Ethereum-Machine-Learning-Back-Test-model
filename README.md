* Designed a predictive framework to forecast ETH/USD price movements using advanced machine learning techniques.
* Engineered features from historical price, volume, and volatility data to capture short-term market dynamics.
* Conducted model selection via grid search and evaluated algorithms including Random Forest, XGBoost, and stacked ensembles.
* Optimize model based on cross-validation performance; fine-tuned hyperparameters using Bayesian optimization.
* Backtested model predictions against historical market data to assess accuracy and cumulative returns.
